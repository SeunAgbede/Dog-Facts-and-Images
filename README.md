# Dog Facts and Images

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e5759852-4e32-4156-bde4-fbb44e9af446/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/quizzical-galileo-ab85bf/deploys)

Built this application using free public apis from this really cool repo
https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

The facts may take a few seconds to fetch because a proxy server was setup to go around the Dog facts api missing CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'. 

Styled with bulma + some custom CSS | Hosted on netlify
