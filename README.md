# Dog-api

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e5759852-4e32-4156-bde4-fbb44e9af446/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/quizzical-galileo-ab85bf/deploys)

Built this application using free Random Dog facts public api from this really cool repo
https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis

The Random fact may take a few seconds to fetch because a proxy server was setup to go around the Random Dog facts public apiCORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing 

Styled with bulma + some custom CSS | Hosted on netlify
